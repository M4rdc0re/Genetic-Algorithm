# Genetic Algorithm

Combinatorial optimization problem using metaheuristic algorithms. In particular, I will implement genetic algorithms to address the vehicle routing problem. In this, a vehicle with limited capacity must pick up packages at different locations and move them to a central pick-up location.

In addition, the performance of different genetic algorithms on different instances of the problem will be analyzed and compared.
